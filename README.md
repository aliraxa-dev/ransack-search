# Ransack Search Implementation in Ruby on Rails

This project showcases the implementation of Ransack, a powerful search library for Ruby on Rails applications. With Ransack, users can perform advanced searches across multiple attributes and associations of ActiveRecord models.

## Features

- **Ransack Gem Integration**: Utilizes the Ransack gem to enable flexible and efficient searching within the Rails application.
- **Customizable Search**: Users can search based on various criteria, including attributes, associations, and custom predicates.
- **Fake Data Generation**: Fake data has been generated using the Faker gem to demonstrate the search functionality with realistic data.
- **Fully Rails Based**: Built entirely on Ruby on Rails, ensuring seamless integration with existing Rails applications and familiarity for Rails developers.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies by running `bundle install`.
3. Migrate the database schema with `rails db:migrate`.
4. Seed the database with fake data using `rails db:seed`.
5. Start the Rails server with `rails server`.
6. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the application.

## Usage

- **Performing Searches**: Navigate to the search page and use the provided form to enter search criteria.
- **Refining Searches**: Experiment with different search parameters, including keywords, date ranges, and associations, to refine search results.
- **Viewing Results**: Search results will be displayed in real-time, allowing users to quickly find the information they need.
